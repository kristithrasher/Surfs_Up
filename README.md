## Overview

Data Analysis for a business investor, W. Avy. The business venture is for a potential surf and shake shack to be located in Oahu, Hawaii.  W. Avy gave me a weather database in SQLite. W.Avy wants to know if the weather conditions would be appropriate for a surf and shake shop. He specifically wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to dermine if the surf and shake shop business is sustainable year round.  
First step in analysis was to retrieve the temperature data for month of June in Oahu. W. Avy provided me a sqlite database titled "hawaii.sqlite". I used Python, Pandas funtions and methods, and SQLAlchemy to filter the date column of the Measurements table in "hawaii.sqlite" database to retrieve all the temperatures of the month of June and December. I then converted those temperatures to a list and created two seperate DataFrames entitled june_df and dec_df from the two lists to generate the summary statistics.

## Deliverable 3 
## Summary
Analysis of the weather in Oahu for both June and December provided W. Avy with some solid statistical analysisâ€”such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. The results were very close in temperature in June and December with only small difference in temperatures in June and December. The average temperature for both months were only 3 degrees different. It shows the consistency in weather throughout the year in Oahu. The temperature data provided shows that Oahu would be a great place to open a surf and shake shop.
