Data Analysis for a business investor, W. Avy. The business venture is for a potential surf and shake shack to be located in Oahu, Hawaii.  W. Avy gave us a dataset of weather database in SQLite. We will be used python code in a jupyter notebook and new tools such as SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask to work on analysis. 
First step in analysis was to retrieve the precipitation weather for Oahu. W. Avy supplied you with the data he wants us to use.  Analyzed the precipitation levels and showing him the cold, hard, data that backs up Oahu as the perfect place to surf. I useed the date that W.Avy went surfing for the first time in Oahu. This is how i started to parse my data was with the date of August 23. Created a chart to show trends in our data. provided W. Avy with insight into the weather patterns of a specific location on Oahu where you would like to build your shop. Used visulization by plotting the results of our precipitation analysis. 
One trend we can observe based on this plot is that some months have higher amounts of precipitation than others.
we want to make sure to provide W. Avy with some solid statistical analysisâ€”such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.
